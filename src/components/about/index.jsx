                        <p class="mb-6 text-sm font-semibold lg:text-base">Haven't we seen in colleges how clubs do not promote real talent, skills and leadership skills?  What if there are people bubbling with ideas and are not getting a chance to showcase due to rigorous process of convincing the clubs which are always filled with nepotism? Hence, what about a global community or a platform where one would acually work on their desored skills, there would be no rigorous rules on convincing required to conduct events and actual work would take place? A place where we build stuff, we let people build stuff and contribute in their own little way? Where we are free to conduct events and independently improve on our skills of leadership? Thois will promote the passion burning iniside which gets hidden die to rigorous college club procedures and often we find introverts pulling back.
